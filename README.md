# Scripts for a new server
This project contains a set of scripts used by the CTS-IT team at the 
University of Florida. It allows a server with a barebones Debian install
to get up and going using Kerberos and SSH (with gatorlink authentication).

# Installation instructions
To get going, there is a setup.sh script in the parent directory.
This script requires root privileges in order to do installs and 
overwrites of protected files. 

Some things in the setup may want to be ignored, such as changing the
networking settings. To do this, just comment out the line of the 
section that is not needed.
